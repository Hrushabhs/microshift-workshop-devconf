# Welcome to the Airgapped MicroShift Workshop

The environment is being prepared for you. We have already:
- Installed **skopeo** and **git**.
- Started a **local container registry** at `localhost:5000`.
- Mirrored all required **MicroShift** and **OKD** images to the local registry.
- Cloned the workshop source code into `~/workshop`.

**Please wait for the progress bar in the terminal to finish before clicking "Start".**
